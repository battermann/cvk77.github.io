# Parser combinators

When tasked to extract information from a string, most seasoned developers - especially the ones with some kind of Linux background - will resort to regular expressions. While regular expressions are incredibly powerful and very well suited for most parsing jobs, with increasing complexity they tend to become very cryptic or even unreadable.

In functional programming, it's common to use parser combinators that combine small basic parsers to build a complex ruleset. Erik Meijers functional programming MOOC at edX recently covered the topic, closely following Graham Hutton's great book "Programming in Haskell".

Let's see how parser combinators can be used in an (admittedly simple) context.

One of our customers runs a fascinating webservice: Using a straightforward URL scheme, you can remotely control a rendering engine that can effectively combines hundreds of different car parts in order to render a photorealistic image of a specific car configuration.

We will use parser combinators to write a parser that extracts the configuration-specific data from such a webservice call.

## The webservice

As mentioned before, the URL format is quite straightforward, but at first glance it seems to be more developer-friendly than parser-friendly, but more about that later. It consists of the following parts:

1. The country version's iso code
1. Car metadata (model is mandatory, body and grade are optional)
1. Optional codes for
    1. option codes
    1. equipment packs
    1. accessories
1. Image metadata like resolution, background colour and car angle.

```
https://example.org
    /de
    /vehicle/trabant/5-doors/0815+universal
    /options/1,4711,815
    /packs/p7
    /accessories/a,b,c
    /width/1024
    /height/768
    /exterior-45.jpg
```

As you can see, there is quite a bit of inconsistency: the country code doesn't have a qualifier, the car model, body and grade info are delimited by slashes, the other fields are delimited by commas.

## The library

The basic idea of a parser is that it takes an input, reads ("consumes") it until itâ€™s either done or fails and then returns both the result and the remaining unparsed string, which might be fed into subsequent parsers. In this example we will be using Haskell's Parsec library to manage this grunt work for us. It seems well-suited for this task, it's quite readably and as straightforward as something that calls itself "industrial strength, monadic parser combinator" can be. Also there are many clones and implementations in mainstream languages like Java, C#, Python or F#.

As mentioned before, parser combinators are built up from simple building blocks combined to complex parsers. It's fascinating that all parsers are independent and can be executed on their own, so everything is easily maintainable and testable. Don't worry if you don't know Haskell - the parsers are so tiny any readable that you should be able to understand what's going on without knowing the language. If you're really interested in seeing how the same parsers look in Java's JParsec, you'll find the code in the footnotes.

## Writing the parser

We're dealing with an URL, so it's quite obvious that we will encounter "things delimited by slashes". According to the webservice specifications, the values can only consist of characters and numbers. We'll start with a parser that reads these symbols and call it `value`.

```
value = do
    many1 alphaNum
```

Let's ignore the `do` for now and just assume it means "expect this in sequential order". When run, `value` parses one or more (`many1`) letters or numbers (`alphaNum`). If the input matches these characters it will return the value, if it encounters any other symbol, it will fail.

The webservice specifications also allow the use of "+" and "-" in values, so we'll need to add these to our parser using the `<|>`-operator that basically just means "or":

```
value = do
    many1 (alphaNum <|> char '+' <|> char '-')
```

Now we have everything we need to combine this parser to another parser that reads the separate parts of our URL (you remember: things delimited by slashes). For lack of a better name, let's call it `part`.

```
part = do
    char '/'
    value
```

This does exactly what you might expect: It reads the character "/" and then a `value` as defined before. The result of the last line in our `do`-block is returned.

I mentioned that parser functions either return the value or fail. In imperative programming languages, failing usually means that some kind of error or exception will be thrown. Our parsers work a bit differently: Haskell has an datatype called `Either` that represents values with two possibilities called `Left` and `Right`. By convention, `Left` is used to hold an error value and `Right` is used to hold a correct value. You'll see in a minute how that looks.

Let's confirm in Haskell's REPL that our parsers work. For this we'll use the `parse` command which expects the following parameters: the parser to execute, a name that we'll just leave empty as we don't need it and the input string. You probably already noticed that Haskell doesn't need braces `()` around function parameters.

```
> parse part "" "/foo+bar-42"
Right "foo+bar-42"

> parse part "" "quux"
Left (line 1, column 1):
unexpected "q"
expecting "/"
```

Nice! Now let's start to do some real work and write a parser that reads the first part of the URL including the country code and return that. We can reuse our `part`-parser again here and will introduce two new parsers: `string`, which reads a string (as opposed to `char` that only reads a single character) and `optional` that (surprise!) marks a parser as optional.

```
country = do
    string "http"
    optional (char 's')
    string "://example.org"
    part
```

We'll skip the vehicle part for now and implement the parsers for the car customization first. Options, accessories and packs are all quite similar: a key followed by a slash and a comma separated list of values. Let's start with an interesting parser: `sepBy` splits a string using a separator and returns the results. The output won't be a string now, but a list of strings instead:

```
commaDelimited = do
    value `sepBy` (char ',')
```

In the REPL this looks like this:

```
> parse commaDelimited "" "1,2,3,4"
Right ["1","2","3","4"]
```

The rest is easy:

```
packs = do
    string "/packs/"
    commaDelimited

options = do
    string "/options/"
    commaDelimited

accessories = do
    string "/accessories/"
    commaDelimited
```

With that out of the way we can concentrate on the most interesting part now: The vehicle information that can consist of one or more `part`s. Let's start with a quite naive approach:

```
vehicle = do
    string "/vehicle"
    many1 part
```

This will obviously not work as it will read beyond the vehicle information and into the customization:

```
> parse vehicle "" "/vehicle/ford/prefect/packs/pack307"
Right ["ford","prefect","packs","pack307"]
```

We need a way to tell the parser where to stop. That can be done with the `manyTill` parser that runs a parser until another parser matches. The problem is that the parser works greedily - so any character that is already consumed stays consumed, even if the parser fails at a later point. We can circumvent this by using the `try` statement that makes the parser only consume input when it's fully executed. 

```
customization = do
    choice [try packs, try accessories, try options]

vehicle = do
    string "/vehicle"
    manyTill part (lookAhead customization)
```

That's it, we don't need the rest:

```
theRest = do
    skipMany anyChar
```

Joining everything together:

```
parser = do
    country <- country
    vehicle <- vehicle
    customization <- many1 customization
    rest <- theRest
    eof
    return (country, vehicle, customization, rest)
```

```
> parse parser "https://example.org/de/vehicle/trabant/5-doors/0815+universal/options/1,4711,815/packs/p7/accessories/a,b,c/width/1024/height/768/exterior-45.jpg"
Right ("de",["trabant","5-doors","0815+universal"],[["1","4711","815"],["p7"],["a","b","c"]])
```
